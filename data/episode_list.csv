Anyhow, due to my petite stature, I already know I can't go into high class modeling. Which has the You must be this tall to ride this ride. kind of attitude. Which is pretty stupid. What does height have to do with anything. So I was like eff it.

The tweet by the famous sexy cosplayer was immediately shared on the social web, and managed to earn over 40,000 retweets and 30,000 favorites within the first 5 days after posting.

74117,"Findings","1. Discerning lies from writing, is pretty hard. LOL  Personality analysis part of it is slightly easier.  Hahah And of course it wasn't all negative. There are a lot of intelligent, thirsty for knowledge life forms with love of books. Some romantic, honest, imaginative and friendly beings as well. ^^  I haven't had the chance to go through all the handwritings. From the samples I see so far...lol   I told my roommates what I think of some of the handwritings. Because I feel like some might belong to troubled individuals.   Ruby: Have you talked to them?  Me: No. lol I can't do feels.  Ruby: I think you'll make a good psychologist minus the fact you don't give a crap.  Emotions are tricky. I'm no professional psychologist and if I inadequately handle your feelings (which I will) I might damage you even more.   Also, since I'm still learning. I just might be wrong in what I see.   But it's hard to confirm whether my findings are right or wrong. Most people tend to get defensive, especially when it comes to vulnerable things or negative traits. (Understandably) For positive traits that I'd name, they mostly agree. Until I get to the negative traits, then suddenly, mostly wrong.   Since I'm still learning. And many of your handwritings have unfamiliar traits. I'd have to bury my head back in books to figure them out.   I'm going to be such a snail shuffling through all the samples.

I think sometimes I identify that certain things are a lie...but sometimes my brain refuses to accept it. For example I hate chocolate. The person might mean it. But I'm having a hard time understanding how someone can dislike chocolate... Like what? LOL. I must be wrong.  You know what I mean? Hahahah Mind effing myself.  No, this isn't for a class. I just have a addiction to graphology. And I study it for fun.  Several of you asked me what I think of your handwriting. Well, asking me to judge you on 3 sentences, where 2 are lies, is a bit unfair to you, don't you think? LMFAO.  Plus, the way you angle your paper, then take a photo of a zoomed in writing, may cause CRUCIAL changes to the analysis of your writing and it might be inaccurate.  You have to scan the entire page of your writing properly. Your writing also changes to a certain degree depends on your mood at the moment. If you're stressed out at the moment. And you give me a piece of handwriting when you're stressed out. I might accidentally think you're cray...or aggressive with anger issues. *rambles on and on* Tapastic says it's too long...so go to http://snailords.deviantart.com/art/Lie-To-Me-2-493238688 for the full ramble on how to submit a proper writing for analysis.","Slice of Life,Comedy,Fantasy","http://aws.tapastic.com/images/x/3b/ed/0a/58/9701078c222b45ea9da70ee96544b4ac.jpg","http://tapastic.com/episode/72811","http://d2me59s95dy7e.cloudfront.net/cartoons/35/03/ac/ba/fe44e97a92be4887bf071cdbed5773ab.jpg"

71515,"A Brief Intermission","Alright team, we're finally caught up on Frankie Comics reruns. Congratulations! Thank you so much for reading this far. I'm glad you're enjoying the comics.  I had planned to start running the new strips this week but I've decided to hold off for a week. New Frankie Comics will start up again next Monday, November 10th.  In the meantime, I want you to check out some of my other comics (for free) and show you some rad things you can spend money on if you're into that.  First is my online store over at http://shop.mixtapecomics.com/ -- I have printed mini-comic versions of Frankie Comics available, along with Frankie stickers, posters, and original art.  If you like t-shirts, prints, and iPhone covers, there's more Frankie merch over at https://www.teepublic.com/user/mixtapecomics and http://www.society6.com/racheldukes  If you'd like to read digital versions of my older work (2003-2012), there's a lot of that up at Gumroad (for pay what you want): http://www.gumroad.com/mixtapecomics  There's also old journal comics (from 2008-2011, leading into Frankie Comics) for free over at http://www.mixtapecomics.com/journalcomic/  There's almost 100 pages of newer work (2011-2014) that you can read for free up at my website: http://www.mixtapecomics.com/?page_id=45  And there's always new work being posted on my Tumblr http://mixtapecomics.tumblr.com/ and my Patreon http://www.patreon.com/mixtapecomics  Hope that's enough to tide you over. See you next week! <3","Slice of Life,Comedy","http://aws.tapastic.com/images/x/b8/20/54/c3/c88b0c556882447dadb3fa41832b3a91.jpg","http://tapastic.com/episode/71515","http://d2me59s95dy7e.cloudfront.net/cartoons/93/82/5c/f1/1ad6ad4c71de48b2b962819abc5deaa1.jpg"
